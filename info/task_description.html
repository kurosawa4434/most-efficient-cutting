<p>
Metal strips, pipes, rods, etc. are being delivered in lengths of 6000 millimeter (6 meters). We want to cut them in pieces of different lengths.
</p>

<p>
Write a piece of code that finds how to do this in to most efficient way, that is, with the less possible material wasted.
You are given the necessary pipe lengths (a list of integer). You should find the most efficient way to cutting, and return the sum of wasted pipe length. 
</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong> A BOM (Bill Of Materials), a list of length in millimeters that have to be cut (list of integer).
</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The sum of wasted pipe length (Integer).
</p>

<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">
most_efficient_cutting([3000, 2200, 2000, 1800, 1600, 1300]) == 100
most_efficient_cutting([4000, 4000, 4000]) == 6000
</pre>

<p>
<strong>How it is used:</strong><br>
find the efficient way to use resouce.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
all(1 <= b <= 6000 for b in bom)
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
