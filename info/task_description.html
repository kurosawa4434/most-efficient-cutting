<p>
Metal strips, pipes, rods, etc. are being delivered in lengths of 6000 millimeter (6 meters). We want to cut them in pieces of different lengths.
</p>

<p>
Write a piece of code that finds how to do this in the most efficient way, that is, with the less possible material wasted.
You are given the requested pipe lengths (as a list of integers). You should find the most efficient way of cutting, and return the sum of wasted pipe length. 
</p>

<p><strong>Input: </strong> A 'BOM' (Bill Of Materials), a list of lengths in millimeters that have to be cut (list of integer).
</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>The sum of wasted pipe length (Integer).
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">
most_efficient_cutting([3000, 2200, 2000, 1800, 1600, 1300]) == 100
most_efficient_cutting([4000, 4000, 4000]) == 6000
</pre>

<p>
<strong>How it is used:</strong><br>
To find the most efficient way of using resources.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
all(1 <= b <= 6000 for b in bom)
</p>
<ul>
</ul>
